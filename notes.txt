modify words, inputs and buttons to project.

change html this:
<!-- <title>Signin Template Â· Bootstrap v5.3</title> -->
to Newsletter Signup
change the svg address to folder images\your image.
eg: website superstars logo.

8:23

for changed to this with types changed to text and email.
text changed too.

<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="First Name" required autofocus>
<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Last Name" required>
<input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Email Address" required>

end code.
required autofocus (blue around)
and required,
added.

change styles.css from this

.form-signin input[type="email"] {
  margin-bottom: -1px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;
}

.form-signin input[type="password"] {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border-top-left-radius: 0;

added top, middle bottom after form-control.

end code.

this makes the forms rounded top bottom and middle square.

it's now static page.
need server get method.
and for express

CHALLENGE

setup get method for home route and
get route to signup to test localhost:3000

SH SOLUTION

app.get("/", function(req,res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname+ "/signup.html");
});

correct.

but image and css is gone.
because bs stylesheet is from remote
but custom is from local, same with images.
for server to serve static files (css, images),
must use special function called static.

app.use(express.static("public")); // public is the folder

app.get("/", function(req,res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname+ "/signup.html");
});

inside newsletter... new folder public. add folder class,
place styles.css in there, and images folder there in public.
then usign app.use static... should be able to refer to the static files
by a relative url, relative to the public folder.
do
signup.html
    <link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
for images
    <img class="mb-4" src="images\bootstrap-logo.svg" alt="" width="72" height="57">
    wasn't css\images, not sure why.
now it's rendered.

CHALLENGE

program the post route
use body-parser to grab data from form and console log from server.

app.js code (using bodyParser, app post with vars, ):

/*jshint esversion: 6 */

const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));

app.get("/", function(req,res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname+ "/signup.html");
});

app.post("/", function(req, res){

  var firstName = req.body.fName;
  var lastName = req.body.lName;
  var email = req.body.email;
  console.log(firstName, lastName, email);
});

app.listen(3000, function(){
console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});

html for values (name="..."):

<div class="form-signin">
  <input type="text" name="fName" class="form-control top" placeholder="First Name" required autofocus>
  <input type="text" name="lName" class="form-control middle" placeholder="Last Name" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" class="form-control bottom" placeholder="Email" required>
</div>

AND ANGELA SAYS TO KEEP A COPY OF THE APP.JS CODE BECAUSE IT'S REPEATED IN
ALL NODE.JS SERVER APPLICATIONS.

if input on form, nothing on hyper,
because html form doesn't have action.
for post req to happen specify method as post and action to home route.

change form
<form class="text-centre " action="/" class="form-signin" method="POST">
...
</form>
so that when click submit, action gets posted and picked up in the

app.post("/", function(req, res){

  var firstName = req.body.fName;
  var lastName = req.body.lName;
  var email = req.body.email;
  console.log(firstName, lastName, email);
});

action is the location (home route action="/")

hyper
a b a@b.com
apple mac apple@mac.com

so it gets logged in hyper, bodyparser working,
form submits data in the inputs to the home route using post request.

now done prep work, getting data in teh inputs.

add this:
var data = {

    email_address: email,
    status: "subscribed",
    merge_fields: {
      FNAME: firstName,
      LNAME: lastName,
    } //see most contacts come with fname lname in call caps. see documenation
  }]
}
this is the object in js.
we need json.
const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);// send to mailchimp.
change vars to const because they won't change.

next make request.
node js documentation http module want to post (not just get),
https.request
add url and options.

according to node.js documentation
must save data in const,
then use const req to send to mailchimp servers
using request.write()

check hyper no errors, localhost:3000, try to sign up.
she went to localhost:3000, but that wasn't the address.
it was:
signup.html?
do 3000 anyway.
i got error:

problem with the api key.
sh: move on.
also css layout gone back.
what was the othe rpage she used?

there are errors in the github example. eg: no ;

sh: possible api key might be wrong or written wrong.
or maybe authentication is wrong or i
have wrong auth for uk. should be uk or eu.

if it worked, hyper would show new member...
can add a new person.
look again then more.

website has small faults.
might have feedback and success page.

250. Adding Success and Failure Pages

mustn't let page time-out.

CHALLENGE
how figure out what response code back,
if 200, send info.

sh: can find the other solution to this module. not today.

if not 200, send another message.

skip because she already wasted 2h.

solution
tap response and get status,

The Udemy Affiliate Program is run in Linkshare and other affiliate networks.
https://www.udemy.com/affiliate/

sh: add the loop in after const request variable,
const request = https.request(url, options, function(response){

if (response.statusCode === 200) {
  res.send("You have subscribed!");
} else {
  res.send("There was an error with signing up, please try again!");
}

response.on("data", function(data){
  console.log(JSON.parse(data));
  })
});
end code. not sure if it works.

sh. even though it doesn't work, the message does work.
also in hyper, message key not any good.

she got subsribed.
but eg: if api key wrong or list key wrong.
message there was an error with signing up...

but the answer is too plain.
use bs to jazz up.
success.html and failure.html.
include some bootstrap code.
bs website components. add jumbotron.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/jumbotron/
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1 class="display-4">Nope</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content or information.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>There was a problem signing you up. Please try again.</p>
</div>
another in the success html.

<h1 class="display-4">Awesome</h1>
<p class="lead">This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content or information.</p>
<hr class="my-4">
<p>You've been signed up to the newsletter, look forward to lots of awesome conent.</p>

to use bs, need bs stylesheet.

project log.
4:11 / 8:55



CHALLENGE

how to send succcess and other pages.

sh. skip the challenges in this.

SOLUTION

if (response.statusCode === 200) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/success.html");
} else {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "failure.html");
}

code:
// a js object. then authenticae (documents) //it's any string, colon to separate then api ke. // in auth. make sure regionmatches (us)
const request = https.request(url, options, function(response){

if (response.statusCode === 200) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/success.html");
} else {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/failure.html");
}

response.on("data", function(data){
  console.log(JSON.parse(data));
  })
});

request.write(jsonData);
request.end();
});

end code.
this sends to the page but hyper says wrong key...
it won't go to the correct page, possibly because
of api key... yes.
move on.
can get the correct way elsewhere like youtube.
sh. here are youtube links:
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=api+mailchimp+mailing+list
end links.

continue.

other thing to address.
nice if they didn't sign up, have button try again back to original page.

using app.js add form.

<p>There was a problem signing you up. Please try again.</p>
<form class="" action="/" method="post">
  <button type="submit" name="button">Try Again</button >
</form>

5:57 / 8:55
1h

give form bootstrap classes.
  <button class="btn btn-lg btn-warning" type="submit" name="button">Try Again</button >
make the button work.

// below post request for the home route, add another one.
// sends to the listner then to app.get home page.
app.post("/failure", function(req, res){
  res.redirect("/");
})

app.post("/failure", function (req, res){
  res.redirect("/");
});




sh. however, that didn't work.
move on.

q&a solutions.

251. Deploying Your Server with Heroku

can't use github pages... that only use support static pages,
unless you make your own 24h server.
cost to buy, and maintain software...
says lots of work.
rent server from someone else. get them to do the work.

one of best is heroku.
rent for free.
create up to 5 projects for free.
sh. that's very good since can install wordpress there.

sign up.
heroku message.
heroku means hero, so it's human.

Use Salesforce Authenticator to verify your identity and sensitive transactions. Authenticator is a free app that runs on iOS or Android mobile devices.

Download Salesforce Authenticator from the App Store or Google Play and install it on your mobile device.
Open the app and tap Add an Account
The app shows you a unique two-word phrase. Enter the phrase.
Two-Word Phrase

sh. the heroku is not free anymore,
and the saleforce authenticator is not free.

students recommend Glitch
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/18125215#questions/18788284

and tutorial.
https://youtu.be/3hVf4Giy5nc

i think just do the module and don't use heroku.
just take notes and move on.
no reviews on scam advisor.
says must join other things.

sh: maybe use the service leon noel recommends.
https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-website-hosting-compared/
move on. this is another waste of time.
i don't need a hosting site. i have xampp.

Specifying a Ruby Version

The default Ruby version is listed along with the other supported Native Environments.

You can customize the Ruby version for your app by adding a .ruby-version file or by setting the ruby directive in your Gemfile. If a version is set in both places .ruby-version will take priority.

To avoid any version mismatch confusion it can help to a single version set in .ruby-version and have the Gemfile read from it, for example:

Your .ruby-version could look like this:

3.1.2
Then the Gemfile can reference .ruby-version via the ruby directive:

ruby File.read('.ruby-version').strip

https://docs.railway.app/deploy/exposing-your-app

Exposing Your App
Before your application can say hello, Railway needs to know the IP and port that your application is listening on, in order to expose it to the internet.

The easiest way to get up and running is to have your application listen on 0.0.0.0:$PORT, where PORT is a Railway-provided environment variable.

Alternatively, you can manually override the PORT environment variable by adding PORT to your projects variables page. (Command + K and type Variables or you can use the keyboard shortcut: G + V under your selected project)

Secure Your Account
Heroku requires that you enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an extra layer of protection for your Heroku account.

Enroll using Salesforce Authenticator, Google Authenticator or your favorite app.

Remember to create backup verification methods by visiting Account Settings.

We strongly recommend registering multiple verification methods so that you can always access your account. For example, if youâre using a mobile authenticator app as your primary verification method, itâs a good idea to also generate temporary recovery codes in case you forget or lose your mobile device.

In this step youâll install the Heroku Command Line Interface
When installation completes, you can use the heroku command from your terminal.

Logged In
You can close this page and return to your CLI (command line interface).
It should now be logged in.

This authentication is required for both the heroku
and git commands to work correctly.

If youâre behind a firewall that requires use of a proxy to connect with external HTTP/HTTPS services, you can set the HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY environment variables
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli#using-an-http-proxy

click i have installed these.
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#prepare-the-app

If you are new to Heroku, it is recommended that you complete this tutorial using the Heroku-provided sample application.
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preparing-a-codebase-for-heroku-deployment
example code:

but angela wants to run the newsletter code.
prepare own app.
need update app.js
listen not on local.
listen on
it might pick port for your port for you,

you must change to this for that to work.

code:
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function(){
console.log("Server is running in port 3000")
});

it's a dynamic port and changes by heroku.
that works wiht their systeem.
now if run using local host our pc won't know
what to do.

if want to test local and on heroku.
tell app to listen to heroku or 3000

staging area is necessary, because might not want
every file to be commited so that's when we decide.
then commit using git commit -m "change".
that version is given a name in the commit.
then could use git checkout to revert back.

eg: working c3 messed up. have saved the file.
have version control and git enabled.
revert changes made.

git status to that we have modifications in c3 not yet committed.
so we can revert back to previous.

before that use git command to see differences between
c3 now and previous.
sh: change c3. then:

this says it's compatible with that.
so it's 15 w?
says slow charge.
Great for the price but slow charge
From the information we have available I can confirm this USB-C Mains Charger and Cable does not have fast charge capabilities it is just a standard charger.
Thank you for using Q&A
Answered by LH
sh: just get a lead?
5 watts
How much electricity does a phone charger use? Generally, phone chargers use about 5 watts (W) of electricity. Some faster chargers can use up to 20 W, but the majority of standard chargers are more around the 5 W range.
i think mine are 3 or 4 watts. amazon is 4 watts.
i could use a belkin from argos for Â£15 and it's safe. it's 20 w
https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9336720?clickSR=slp:term:usb%20c%20phone%20charger:2:130:1
it's safe to use in 15w phone.
i paid 80 for phone.
now 15 for charger.
or just get a 4 lead.

Donât waste your money. Claims to go from 0-50 in 24 minutes, mine went from 18-30 in 26â¦ maybe works if you have a special fast charge cable but thatâs an added expense to pay out for. Doesnât work with a normal cable. And the plus itself is quite bulky as well.

bought this because I was previously spending 12 hours charging my new iPad Air 2022 from low charge. I didn't appreciate that I needed a high wattage charger so searched around and found this plug and thought I'd try it and see. What a difference, takes less than two hours now to fully charge this device. I bought another as it was good value and a recognized brand. It would be even better if it was dual port but at this price I can't complain.

i think both ends are usb-c. so you need a usb2,3 lead anyway.
just buy a cheap one on ebay.

- You are not logged in to your account: see File > Options.
- You may need to log out and log back in to refresh your token.
- You do not have permission to access this repository.
- The repository is archived on GitHub.
Check the repository settings to confirm
you are still permitted to push commits.
- If you use SSH authentication, check that your key

Verify remote name / address

If this returns showing that you have remotes set, check that the name of the remote matches the remote you are using in your commands.

$git remote -v
myOrigin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git (fetch)
myOrigin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git (push)

# this will fail because `origin` is not set
$git push origin main

# you need to use
$git push myOrigin main
